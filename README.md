# boostwordmapwithfs
This project used to be one and the same with [wordmapbooster](https://github.com/JEdward7777/wordmapbooster), however as wordmapbooster needed to be used as a library used in the browser, the repo couldn't be contaminated with the node fs library.  So the pieces of the library which used fs were broken off into this as a separate library.

This library provides node based testing of wordmapbooster and also compares it with other non browser based technologies such as [catboost](https://catboost.ai/).
